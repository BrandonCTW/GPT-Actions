# Todoist RESTv2 OpenAPI Documentation

This repository contains the OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification for the Todoist REST API version 2.
The specification is currently version 1.0.0 as of 2023-11-16.
It has been built with intent to use with ChatGPT 4's Action system, but there's nothing in there specific to OpenAI. The spec should be broadly applicable.

## Implementation

### Todoist

The Todoist REST API allows for basic interaction with Todoist, enabling the creation, update, and management of **Projects**, **Sections**, **Tasks**, **Comments**, and **Labels** . Authentication is performed via API token and not OAuth2.

### OpenAI

Integrating OpenAI with the Todoist API can enhance task management through AI-driven insights and automation. Here are some suggestions for implementation:

- **Natural Language Processing**: Use OpenAI's language models to interpret and categorize tasks or generate task descriptions.
- **Automation**: Implement AI-driven task sorting, prioritization, and recommendation systems.
- **Data Analysis**: Leverage OpenAI for analyzing task patterns, productivity trends, and user behavior.
